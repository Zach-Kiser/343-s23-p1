    <h4>History of The JMU Gummy Bear Club</h4>
      <p> The gummy bear lovers club was founded here in gummybearlandia in the year 1985.
        The club was formed by Mrs. and Mr. Gummykins during their time here at JMU.
        They were brought together via there love for gummies. Overtime they relalized that it was something they not
        only wanted but needed to share with others.
        They created this club to bring together all the gummy bear lovers from all over the campus.
        The first Gummy bear lovers meeting was held at 3:00pm May 21st 1985.
        May 21st is a very special day for the memebers of the club.
        The members celebrate by selling gummybears all over then land. All the proceeds are then donated to the less
        fortunate along with gift baskets full of many sweet treats!The main event being the Gummybears, obviously. The
        night is then finshed off with a luxury ball to celebrate our members and all they do for not only this club but
        the community.
